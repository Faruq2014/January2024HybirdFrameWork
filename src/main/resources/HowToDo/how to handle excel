excel has data types--all the data types such as
           text=String
           number= int, double, long,
           boolean==boolean
           date==date
            
and excel automaticly understand data types
also automaticly configure

excel has row such as 1, 2, 3
excel has column such as A,B,C
where row and column meet then it is called Cell
and the value in that intersection is called Cell value

in Selenium most of the time data is WebElement or String
so we must convert any other data in excel to text data

but if your data in selenium or java is numeric then excel data should be double

in Java we handle excel with array list 
and with index
in index row start from= 0
and column start from ==0
Cell is the intersection of row and column


/*
 * name of the workbook==registration
 * sheet name=sheet1,sheet2, test,
 * row==start from 0
 * column == start from 0
 * cell== intersection row and column
 * Faruq=registration.xlsx-->Sheet1-->Row 1-->Column 0==String cell
 * index=start from 0
 * row start from 0
 * column start from 0
 * row always come first
